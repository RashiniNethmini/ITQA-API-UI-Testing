Feature: Price Range Slider

  Scenario: Display products based on the selected price range
    Given I am on the home page
    When I see the price range slider
  


    # When I set the minimum price to "100"
    # And I set the maximum price to "500"
    # Then only products within the price range "100 - 500" should be displayed
